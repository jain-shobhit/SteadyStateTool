# SteadyStateTool: Fast computation of Steady-State response of multi-degree of freedom nonlinear mechanical systems
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/151435739.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/151435739)

This program computes the steady-state response (SSR) of 
multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear mechanical systems under multi-frequency
forcing using the integral equations approach propoposed in the following article:

Please cite the above-mentioned article, if you use SteadyStateTool in your work.

# Installation
Upon downloading and extracting the files, please set the CURRENT FOLDER in MATLAB by browsing to the folder containing startup.m file. 
Thereafter, please run the startup.m file or simple type "startup" in the MATLAB COMMAND WINDOW. 
You are now ready to play with examples and create new ones!

# Remarks
We have tested this program with MATLAB version 2018a,2018b,2019a,2019b. 

Please report any issues to Shohit Jain (shjain at ethz dot ch)
